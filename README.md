A simple and easy-to-use, yet configurable in-memory message bus in C#.

It strongly draws from the EventStore message bus design while adding useful, configurable features like saga support, simplified handler registration, access control. You only pay for what you use.

We'll port this to .NET Core when the dust settles.

I hope you find it as useful as I have.
